# Youtube Downloader

This is a youtube downloader with simple UI that uses vanilla html and css for the frontend and javascript (with the ytdl-core module) for the backend.

The UI and backend is complete, but the only problem is to connect them.
This project is not complete as it has to deal with some firefox compabilty issues with ES6. As a result, I can't connect my backend to the frontend. For now, I will skip this project and come back later after I have more knowledge regarding this issue.

This project is not continued as I have already finished a similiar project with different approach. I use rest api for the completed project and it work fine, you can find it here [`ytdl-interface`](https://github.com/towtin/ytdl-interface)
